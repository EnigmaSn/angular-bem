## Changelog

### 2.0.0

## Need to know
* These directives don't affect scope or other directives. So you can use them at ease wherever you want.
* You can only specify one element or block on single node. This limitation greatly simplify code of module and your app.
* There is **no way** to create an element of parent block **inside** nested block. It's not a component-way. So please avoid it.
